These are the notebooks for the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) data analysis.
This data is obtained from the Nairobi stock exchange market, cleaned and analysed.
Two machine learning models are then trained on the data:

    1. light-gbm model for linear regression which will predict the next price 
       in the market, given all the dependent  variables
    
    2. XGBoot model for clasifying whether the price would be low or high 
       during a certain date
